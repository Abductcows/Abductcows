### My name is George. 

I currently use github for small projects to add to my portfolio. My interests are:

  - Software Engineering
  - Android/Kotlin/Java projects and flings
  - Spring (Boot)
  - Game Development with Unity (still have a lot to learn)
  - Android Compose & Compose Multi-platform
  
I am presently working on my own Open Source Java class named `BitArray`. It is a small project in pursuit of completely outclassing `ArrayList<Boolean>` in both performance and memory use. And I am learning a lot along the way such as:
  
- How to structure a project with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (Compilation, dependency handling, even deployment of the final product).    
- How to use a standard versioning scheme like [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).   
- How to write simple and effective tests. Also how to introduce parameters with [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) and fluency with [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) to streamline the process even more. Replace Java with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for the tests and it actually isn't all that bad.  
- How to document adequately for production. In this case, the [Javadoc](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm) on the provided sources along with a generated HTML version is sufficient. 

...and a few bit hacks for the implementation that I came up with. If it seems useful to you or you'd like to contribute, come say [hi](https://github.com/Abductcows/java-bit-array).

[BitArray](https://github.com/Abductcows/java-bit-array) is already usable at version 1.X and will soon be released at 2.0.0 on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central)
